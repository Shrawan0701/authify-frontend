# Authify: Full-Stack Authentication System

##  Architecture

Authify is built on a **Client-Server Architecture** specifically as a **Single-Page Application (SPA) with a RESTful API Backend**.

* The **Frontend (React.js)** acts as a decoupled client, handling all UI rendering and client-side routing.
* The **Backend (Spring Boot)** exposes a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs, handling business logic, data and all security aspects (authentication, authorization).
* Communication between the frontend and backend occurs exclusively via **HTTP requests** (JSON payload) to the REST API endpoints.
* The two components are deployed independently, showcasing a modern, modular approach to full-stack development.

##  Live Demo

Experience Authify in action:

* **Frontend Application:** [https://authify-frontend.vercel.app](https://authify-frontend.vercel.app)
* **Backend API Base URL:** [https://authify-backend-lei1.onrender.com/api/v1.0](https://authify-backend-lei1.onrender.com/api/v1.0)

  This is the base URL for API endpoints. You will see an "Unauthorized" message when visiting directly, which is expected for a secured API.
  

##  Features

* **User Registration (Sign Up):** Securely create new user accounts.
* **User Login:** Authenticate users with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management.
* **Authentication Persistence:** Maintain user login status across page refreshes using HttpOnly.
* **Email Verification (OTP):** OTP-based email verification for new registrations.
* **Password Reset (OTP):** Securely reset forgotten passwords via OTP sent to registered email.
* **User Logout:** Securely terminate user sessions.
* **Responsive UI:** Adapts seamlessly across various devices using Bootstrap.
* **Error Handling:** Clear and informative messages for both API and UI errors.
